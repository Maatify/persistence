# Contributing to maatify/persistence

Thank you for considering contributing to `maatify/persistence`! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this specific package.

## Package Identity

Before contributing, please understand the scope and intent of this package:

* **Standalone Composer Package**: This is a standalone, reusable package.
* **Framework-Agnostic**: It does not depend on or bind to any specific framework.
* **Host-Agnostic**: It does not contain namespaces, logic, or dependencies tied to a host application.
* **PDO-Based**: It relies entirely on native `\PDO` for database interactions.
* **NOT an ORM**: This package is not an Object-Relational Mapper.
* **No UI/HTTP/Routing**: It does not provide HTTP endpoints, controllers, routes, UI components, or generic application repository frameworks.

## Ways to Contribute

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

* Bug fixes within the package-owned behavior.
* Documentation improvements.
* Adding or improving tests.
* Static analysis and code-style improvements.

Please do not submit PRs that add new architectural domains or components outside the current scope of the package.

## Repository Structure

Contributions should respect the current directory structure:

* `src/`: Contains the production source code.
* `tests/`: Contains the test suites (`unit`, `regression`, and `integration`).
* `docs/`: Contains internal documentation and standards.

## Local Verification

Before submitting a Pull Request, please ensure all local verification steps pass:

```bash
composer install
composer analyse
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run --diff
composer validate --strict
composer test:unit
composer test:regression
```

### Integration Testing

Integration tests require a real MySQL database. SQLite is explicitly **not** supported as a substitute for these tests.

To run the integration suite, ensure you have a local MySQL server and set the following environment variables (adjust values to your local setup):

```bash
export PERSISTENCE_TEST_MYSQL_DSN="mysql:host=127.0.0.1;port=3306;dbname=test_db"
export PERSISTENCE_TEST_MYSQL_USER="test_user"
export PERSISTENCE_TEST_MYSQL_PASSWORD="test_password"
```

Then run:

```bash
composer test:integration
```

Or to run the full test suite:

```bash
composer test
```

## Architectural Contribution Rules

When contributing code, you must adhere to the following architectural rules:

* **No Framework Bindings**: Do not introduce dependencies on any framework (e.g., Laravel, Symfony).
* **No Host Application Namespaces**: All code must reside within `Maatify\Persistence`.
* **No ORM**: Stick to raw `\PDO`.
* **No Host Table Coupling**: The package operates on tables provided via configuration; it must not hardcode host table names.
* **No Generic Repository Abstraction**: Keep the logic specific to the current goals (e.g., PDO ordering utilities).
* **SQL Identifiers**: Table and column names must remain trusted configurations, not raw user input.
* **Prepared Statements**: All runtime values must be bound using prepared statements.
* **Transaction Ownership**: `moveWithinScope()` owns its own transaction. It must reject caller-owned active transactions.
* **Scope Isolation**: Do not break scope isolation; rows outside the affected range must not be moved.
* **No Global Normalization**: Do not perform global normalization of gaps as a side effect of a scoped operation.
* **Rollback Behavior**: Rollbacks must preserve the original error/exception.
* **Exception Handling**: Do not catch every `\PDOException` or external `\Throwable` randomly to wrap it in a package exception. `PersistenceException` is strictly for package-defined exceptions.
* **Composer Lock**: Never commit or create a `composer.lock` file in this repository.

## Pull Request Rules

* **Focused PRs**: Submit one PR per specific fix or feature.
* **No Unrelated Changes**: Keep PRs clean of unnecessary or unrelated modifications.
* **Update Tests and Docs**: Any change in behavior must be accompanied by updated tests and documentation.
* **BC Impact**: Clearly state any Backwards Compatibility (BC) impact in the PR description.
* **Discussion First**: Public API and runtime behavior should not be changed without prior architectural discussion in an Issue.
* **Security**: Do NOT open public issues or PRs for security vulnerabilities. Follow the instructions in `SECURITY.md`.
* **Changelog**: Notable changes should be recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`.
